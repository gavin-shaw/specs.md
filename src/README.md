## What is AI-DLC?

AI-DLC is a reimagined software development methodology where **AI drives the conversation** and humans validate. Unlike traditional Agile where iterations span weeks, AI-DLC operates in **Bolts** - rapid iterations measured in hours or days.

> "Traditional development methods were built for human-driven, long-running processes. AI-DLC reimagines the development lifecycle with AI as a central collaborator, enabling rapid cycles measured in hours or days rather than weeks."

### AI-DLC vs Traditional Methods

| Aspect | Agile/Scrum | AI-DLC |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Iteration duration | Weeks (Sprints) | Hours/days (Bolts) |
| Who drives | Human-driven, AI assists | AI-driven, human-validated |
| Design techniques | Out of scope | Integrated (DDD, TDD, BDD) |
| Task decomposition | Manual | AI-powered |
| Phases | Repeating sprints | Rapid three-phase cycles (Inception → Construction → Operations) |
| Rituals | Daily standups, retrospectives | Mob Elaboration, Mob Construction |

---

## How It Works

specsmd provides four specialized agents that guide you through the entire development lifecycle:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  Master Agent   │  Orchestrates & navigates
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
        ┌────────────────────┼────────────────────┐
        ▼                    ▼                    ▼
┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐
│   Inception   │ → │ Construction  │ → │  Operations   │
│     Agent     │   │     Agent     │   │     Agent     │
└───────────────┘   └───────────────┘   └───────────────┘
  Capture intent      Execute bolts      Deploy & monitor
  Define units        Build & test       Verify & scale
  Plan stories        Validate stages
```

### The Three Phases

| Phase | Agent | Purpose | Key Outputs |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Inception** | Inception Agent | Capture intents, elaborate requirements, decompose into units | User stories, NFRs, Unit definitions, Bolt plans |
| **Construction** | Construction Agent | Execute bolts through domain design → logical design → code → test | Domain models, Technical designs, Code, Tests |
| **Operations** | Operations Agent | Deploy, verify, and monitor | Deployment units, Monitoring, Runbooks |

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npx specsmd install
```

The installer detects your AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) and sets up:
- Agent definitions and skills
- Memory bank structure for context persistence
- Slash commands for easy agent invocation

### Global FIRE Install

```bash
npx specsmd install --global --flow fire --tools claude,codex,cursor
```

Global install installs the FIRE flow once into each selected tool's global home:

- Claude Code: `~/.claude/skills/specsmd-fire*/SKILL.md`
- Codex: `~/.codex/skills/specsmd-fire*/SKILL.md`
- Cursor: `~/.cursor/commands/specsmd-fire*.md`

Only `claude`, `codex`, and `cursor` support global FIRE install. FIRE uses a split storage model:

- Standards live in the repository at `<repo>/.docs/`
- State, intents, and runs live globally at `~/.specs-fire/<project-folder-name>/`

The project key is the repo-root folder name. Two different repositories with the same folder name collide in `~/.specs-fire/`, so rename one folder or migrate manually before proceeding. The global install path does not write `.specsmd/` or per-repo command files into the target repository.

When global FIRE runs in a repo with an old repo-local install, it prompts before migration. On confirmation it moves standards to `.docs/`, moves `state.yaml`, `intents/`, and `runs/` to `~/.specs-fire/<project-folder-name>/`, removes repo-local `specsmd-*` entry points for claude/codex/cursor, and retires repo-local `.specs-fire/`. If the target global folder already exists, migration warns and blocks instead of silently overwriting.

To remove a global install:

```bash
npx specsmd uninstall --global
```

Merge safety: source flow files under `src/flows/fire/**` are not edited for static global paths. Static path changes are produced by install-time rewriting in isolated installer modules, and the runtime state path uses a bounded `fireDir()` hook in the builder scripts that is earmarked for upstream contribution.

Handoff note: the external skillshare `install-specsmd` skill should be updated separately to call `specsmd install --global`; that skill lives outside this repository.

### Live Dashboard (FIRE)

Track FIRE state continuously from terminal:

```bash
npx specsmd@latest dashboard
```

Options:

```bash
npx specsmd@latest dashboard --flow fire --path . --refresh-ms 1000
npx specsmd@latest dashboard --no-watch
```

### Initialize Your Project

```bash
# Start the Master Agent
/specsmd-master-agent

# Then type:
project-init
```

This guides you through establishing:
- **Tech Stack** - Languages, frameworks, databases, infrastructure
- **Coding Standards** - Formatting, linting, naming, testing strategy
- **System Architecture** - Architecture style, API design, state management
- **UX Guide** - Design system, styling, accessibility (optional)
- **API Conventions** - API style, versioning, response formats (optional)

### Create Your First Intent

```bash
/specsmd-inception-agent intent-create
```

An **Intent** is your high-level goal:
- "User authentication system"
- "Product catalog with search"
- "Payment processing integration"

The agent will:
1. Ask clarifying questions to minimize ambiguity
2. Elaborate into user stories and NFRs
3. Define system context
4. Decompose into loosely-coupled units

### Plan and Execute Bolts

```bash
# Plan bolts for your stories
/specsmd-inception-agent bolt-plan

# Execute a bolt
/specsmd-construction-agent bolt-start
```

Each bolt goes through validated stages:
1. **Domain Model** - Model business logic using DDD principles
2. **Technical Design** - Apply patterns and make architecture decisions
3. **ADR Analysis** - Document significant decisions (optional)
4. **Implement** - Generate production code
5. **Test** - Verify correctness with automated tests

**Human validation happens at each stage gate.**

## Key Concepts

### Intent
A high-level statement of purpose that encapsulates what needs to be achieved - whether a business goal, feature, or technical outcome. It serves as the starting point for AI-driven decomposition.

### Unit
A cohesive, self-contained work element derived from an Intent. Units are loosely coupled and can be developed independently. Analogous to a Subdomain (DDD) or Epic (Scrum).

### Bolt
The smallest iteration in AI-DLC, designed for rapid implementation. Unlike Sprints (weeks), Bolts are **hours to days**. Each bolt encapsulates a well-defined scope of work.

| Type | Best For | Stages |
|------|----------|--------|
| **DDD Construction** | Complex business logic, domain modeling | Model → Design → ADR → Implement → Test |
| **Simple Construction** | UI, integrations, utilities | Plan → Implement → Test |

### Memory Bank
File-based storage for all project artifacts. Maintains context across agent sessions and provides traceability between artifacts.

### Standards
Project decisions that inform AI code generation. Standards ensure consistency across all generated code and documentation.

## Why specsmd?

### AI-Native, Not AI-Retrofitted
Built from the ground up for AI-driven development. AI-DLC is a reimagination based on first principles, not a retrofit of existing methods.

### Human Oversight as Loss Function
Validation at each stage catches errors early before they cascade downstream. Each validation transforms artifacts into rich context for subsequent stages.

### Design Techniques Built-In
DDD, TDD, and BDD are integral to the methodology - not optional add-ons. This addresses the "whitespace" in Agile that has led to quality issues.

### Tool Agnostic
Works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other AI coding assistants. Markdown-based agents work anywhere.

### Context Engineering
Specs and Memory Bank provide structured context for AI agents. Agents reload context each session - no more lost knowledge.

## FAQ

**Q: Agents don't seem to remember previous context?**
Each agent invocation starts fresh. Agents read context from the Memory Bank at startup. Ensure artifacts are saved after each step.

**Q: How do I reset project state?**
Clear the `memory-bank/` directory to reset all artifacts. To remove specsmd entirely, delete the `.specsmd/` directory and tool-specific command files.

**Q: Can I use specsmd with existing Agile workflows?**
AI-DLC is designed as a reimagination, not a retrofit. However, familiar concepts (user stories, acceptance criteria) are retained to ease transition.

**Q: What project types is this suited for?**
specsmd is designed for building complex systems that demand architectural complexity, trade-off management, and scalability. Simpler systems may be better suited for low-code/no-code approaches.
